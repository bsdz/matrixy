#summary Checklist for things needing to be implemented for the core syntax of M
#labels Phase-Requirements

This is an unordered checklist of things that need to be implemented to complete the "core" M syntax. There are also large numbers of library functions that need to be implemented, but those will not be listed here.

= TODO List =

  # varagin/varargout
  # Subfunctions (lexically-scoped functions)
  # Multiple function return values (proper {{{ nargout }}} handling)
  # Relational operators are matrix-aware {{{ > >= != <= < }}}
  # Arithmetic operators are matrix-aware {{{ / \ % ^ }}}
  # Vector-indexed assignments {{{ x(1) = 2 }}}
  # LDivide operators {{{ .\ }}}
  # Bitwise Logical operators {{{ & | ~ }}}
  # Ranges {{{ x:y x:y:z }}}
  # Cell arrays
  # Structs and Struct Members
  # Row/Column indexing with {{{:}}}
  # Proper for loops
  # Proper while loops
  # Elseif {{{ elseif }}}
  # Do-Until loops
  # Loop actions {{{ continue break }}}
  # Persistent variables
  # Classes and Objects {{{ classdef properties }}}
  # Class constructors (@foo/foo.m)
  # Exception handling {{{ try catch throw end_try_catch }}}

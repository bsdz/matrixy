An interpreter for **M**, the scripting language used by Matlab/Octave. Matrixy targets the Parrot Virtual Machine.

**UPDATE**: Matrixy has moved: http://github.com/Whiteknight/Matrixy. All new development will happen there instead. This page will be maintained for the forseeable future, though will not host up-to-date code.

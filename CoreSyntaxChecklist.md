This is an unordered checklist of things that need to be implemented to complete the "core" M syntax. There are also large numbers of library functions that need to be implemented, but those will not be listed here.

# TODO List #

  1. varagin/varargout
  1. Subfunctions (lexically-scoped functions)
  1. Multiple function return values (proper ` nargout ` handling)
  1. Relational operators are matrix-aware ` > >= != <= < `
  1. Arithmetic operators are matrix-aware ` / \ % ^ `
  1. Vector-indexed assignments ` x(1) = 2 `
  1. LDivide operators ` .\ `
  1. Bitwise Logical operators ` & | ~ `
  1. Ranges ` x:y x:y:z `
  1. Cell arrays
  1. Structs and Struct Members
  1. Row/Column indexing with `:`
  1. Proper for loops
  1. Proper while loops
  1. Elseif ` elseif `
  1. Do-Until loops
  1. Loop actions ` continue break `
  1. Persistent variables
  1. Classes and Objects ` classdef properties `
  1. Class constructors (@foo/foo.m)
  1. Exception handling ` try catch throw end_try_catch `
